AtliQ Hardware Sales, Finance, and Profit & Loss Report
In this project, I developed comprehensive sales, finance, and profit & loss reports for AtliQ Hardware, covering fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The project required managing large datasets throughout the full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, where I extracted data, transformed it using Power Query, and loaded it into structured data models. I also executed complex queries, created calculated columns, and leveraged DAX formulas to derive meaningful insights.

The results of the analysis were presented through detailed data visualizations, including profit & loss statements and performance dashboards, providing valuable insights to support data-driven decision-making. Below are the key reports included in this project:

1. AtliQ P & L Statement
Description: Generated a detailed Profit & Loss (P&L) statement for AtliQ Hardware summarizing the company’s financial performance.
Process: I extracted financial data, cleaned and transformed it using Power Query, and used DAX to calculate important metrics such as gross profit, operating expenses, and net income.

2. Gross Margin% By Quarters (Sub_zone)
Description: Analyzed gross margin percentage trends by quarters across different sub-zones, giving a regional view of performance.
Process: Used Power Query to extract and clean data, then created DAX formulas to compute gross margin percentages and built visualizations for quarterly performance comparison.

3. Market Performance Report
Description: Developed a market performance report to assess key sales metrics, market share, and growth trends in various markets.
Process: Consolidated sales and market data, used Power Query for transformation, and applied DAX to segment and compare market performance. Created dashboards that highlight market share growth.

4. Net Sales By Division 20, 21
Description: Produced a report on net sales by division for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, providing division-level performance insights.
Process: Extracted division-wise sales data, cleaned and aggregated it using Power Query, and used DAX to calculate and compare net sales across divisions.

5. Net Sales By Products FY 20, 21
Description: Detailed net sales performance by product category for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
Process: Extracted product sales data, merged datasets using Power Query, and used DAX for calculations. Developed visualizations to highlight the top-performing products.

6. Net Sales Report By Customers FY 19, 20, 21
Description: Analyzed net sales data from customers over fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021, identifying key customers and their contribution to sales growth.
Process: Processed customer sales data with Power Query, performed sales aggregation via DAX, and developed a report visualizing customer trends across years.

7. Net Sales of Top 5 Countries FY 21
Description: Generated a report focused on the net sales performance in AtliQ’s top 5 countries during fiscal year 2021.
Process: Used Power Query to clean and filter the sales data by country. DAX calculations were used to determine total sales, and visualizations were created to show the top 5 countries.

8. New Products Launched In 21
Description: Reported on the sales performance of new products launched in 2021.
Process: Extracted and processed product launch data using Power Query. Applied DAX formulas to track performance metrics and built visualizations to analyze the success of the new products.

9. P & L Statement For Markets FY 21
Description: Created a P&L statement by market for fiscal year 2021, providing an in-depth view of financial performance across regions.
Process: Processed market-specific financial data using Power Query and built the P&L statement with DAX, highlighting profitability across different regions.
